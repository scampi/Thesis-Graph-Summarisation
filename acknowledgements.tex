This thesis would not have come to fruit without the help of many people.

I thank my parents for supporting me along this path of research and study. I wish to thank my brother and sister for their support overseas. I would like also to thank my girlfriend, now wife, Kasia for being present throughout this journey. The support of friends was priceless, with Diego Ceccarelli being noteworthy. This thesis is not only the product of my own efforts, but also of everybody I was in contact with during that time. In addition, I am thankful to Grishka for always being happy.

I wish also to thanks my supervisors Giovanni Tummarello and Stefan Decker for guiding me throughout the years, and to Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann for providing me with valuable feedback and supporting me in the last moments. Finally, my years of research would not have been the same without the support, guidance, and patience of my mentor Renaud Delbru.
