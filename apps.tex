\subparagraph{Confidence}

The confidence given to the validity of a statement depends not only on its authority, but on the \emph{point of view} of the user examining the statement as well. For example, the link from $a_2$ to $b_1$ found in \textbf{B} can be \emph{doubtful} ``seen'' from \textbf{A}, but is probably valid in \textbf{B}. The link (dashed and green) from $a_1$ to $b_1$ originating from \textbf{C} is highly questionable, since neither the subject nor the object entities belong to \textbf{C}.
