\chapter{Data Tables of the DAG Ranking Evaluation}

\section{Entity Ranking}

Table~\ref{tab:ranking-cmp-results} reports the evaluation results of comparing MF extensions BM25MF and PL2MF against several state-of-the-art ranking functions. The $p$-Value is computed with the two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test~\cite{sheskin:2003:CRC,buttcher:2010:IRI:1869919}, where a statistically significant difference at level $0.10$ is marked with one star $*$ and at level $0.05$ with two stars $**$. BM25MF and PL2MF are used as a baseline in this test. $\Delta\%$ indicates the difference in percentage between the two MAP values compared in that test.

\input{05-ranking/figures/experiments/ranking-comparison}


Table~\ref{tab:mf-effect} reports the MAP scores of BM25MF and PL2MF combined with each weight individually and using the normalization parameters values from the Table~\ref{tab:norm-param}. Apart from the row ``Without Attribute Label'', all runs consider the attribute label as an additional value as in the previous experiments.

\section{Graph Summary Ranking}
\label{app:summary-ranking}

The queries are grouped by its complexity, as outlined in Section~\ref{sec:summary-ranking:dataset}. A group is identified with the a string having the following regular expression: "\verb/\d+(-\d+)*/". For instance, the string ``\emph{2-1}'' identifies a group of queries that have \textit{two} star-shaped patterns, one with \textit{two} triple patterns and the other with only \textit{one}.

The SPARQL queries below are extracted from the logs available in the USEWOD2013 dataset \cite{usewod:2013}. We make use of the following prefixes:
\begin{labeling}{\textbf{yago:}}
	\item[\textbf{dbo:}] \url{http://dbpedia.org/ontology/}
	\item[\textbf{dbp:}] \url{http://dbpedia.org/property/}
	\item[\textbf{foaf:}] \url{http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/}
	\item[\textbf{geo:}] \url{http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84\_pos#}
	\item[\textbf{rdfs:}] \url{http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#}
	\item[\textbf{skos:}] \url{http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#}
	\item[\textbf{yago:}] \url{http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/}
\end{labeling}
