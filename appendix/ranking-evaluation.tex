\chapter{Data Tables of the DAG Ranking Evaluation}

The $p$-Value is computed with the two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test~\cite{sheskin:2003:CRC,buttcher:2010:IRI:1869919}, where a statistically significant difference at level $0.10$ is marked with one star $*$ and at level $0.05$ with two stars $**$. BM25MF and PL2MF are used as a baseline in this test. $\Delta\%$ indicates the difference in percentage between the two MAP values compared in that test.

Table~\ref{tab:mf-effect} reports the MAP scores of BM25MF and PL2MF combined with each weight individually and using the normalization parameters values from the Table~\ref{tab:norm-param}. Apart from the row ``Without Attribute Label'', all runs consider the attribute label as an additional value as in the previous experiments.
