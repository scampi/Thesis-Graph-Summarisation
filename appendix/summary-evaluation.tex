\chapter{Data Tables of the Graph Summarisation Evaluation}

In this Appendix, we report the raw results of the evaluation conducted on the graph summarisation as presented in Section~\ref{chap5:precision:eval}. Table~\ref{tab:volume-ratio} reports some statistics about the datasets used in the evaluation. In Table~\ref{tab:cpu-time} we report performance results of computing summaries over the datasets. We report in Tables~\ref{tab:precision-conn}~and~\ref{tab:precision-schema} the \gls{connectivity} and \gls{schema} precisions measurements of several summaries generated from the datasets.

	\caption[Computational performance of graph summaries creation]{Performance comparison. We report the CPU time in $ms$ of the \emph{edges} step in the graph summarisation computation. For each category of dataset complexity, we report the mean $\mu$ of the CPU time.% Due to an error in the computation, we don't report the times for $\sim_{at}$.
