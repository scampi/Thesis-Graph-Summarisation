\section{Conclusion}

- generic framework for summarising graphs
- extracts the structure of a graph
- set of approximate graph summaries to scale to large graphs
- presented an algorithm for computing a graph summary using shared-nothing distributed framework, Hadoop

In this chapter, we presented a generic framework for summarising graphs. It is generic in that different kinds of summarisation are possible. The framework allows to highlight the underlying structure of graphs. Since the produced summary is a graph homomorphic to the entity graph, it can be used instead of the original graph. Since a summary is smaller that its entity graph, this positively impacts the performance of upstream applications.


- update existing summary
- summary of a collection of graphs ?
